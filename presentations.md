**Data warehousing on Hadoop - One important DON'T and a few DOs** ([slide deck](http://go.roche.com/dwh-quickie); presented at [Devoxx PL 2016](http://cfp.2016.devoxx.pl/2016/speaker/marek_grzenkowicz.html))

> At the same time, you can have your lunch and learn why you should attend my evening BOF session. Does it sound like a good deal?

> The brave new world of Big Data has been around for a while and its tools have been successfully applied to solve different problems. But is it a silver bullet? Is it really completely new? Can you forget the old truths of design, architecture and project management?

> The goal of the StraDa project is to gather the log files from hundreds of Roche diagnostic instruments spread around the world and transform these TBs of data into a data warehouse.

> We built it, but it wasn't a straightforward task.

> Please come to learn what was the biggest mistake we made and then come back at 19:30 for a full-blown session.

**Data warehousing on Hadoop - After a few months in production** ([slide deck](http://go.roche.com/dwh-bof); presented at [Devoxx PL 2016](http://cfp.devoxx.pl/2016/speaker/marek_grzenkowicz))

> Medical laboratory instruments produce immense volumes of log files. Until recently, they were used only for trouble shooting and maintenance purposes. However, hidden inside are insights that could allow the laboratory managers to streamline and optimize the diagnostic process.

> The goal of the StraDa project is to gather the log files from hundreds of Roche diagnostic instruments spread around the world, transform these TBs of data into actionable information and make it available for the business users.

> Yet another data warehouse? Sounds reasonably easy? Well, so we thought. And we were wrong.

> Please come to learn about some of the mistakes we made and problems we encountered, so you can avoid them.

> I will have slides, but I donâ€™t need to follow them. Ask questions! Challenge me! Share you own experience!
